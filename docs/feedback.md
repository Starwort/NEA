# Feedback

- make an implementation of the solitaire to interest more stakeholders
  - perhaps develop a variant which is more computationally difficult to solve
- use the solver as a 'hint' function to suggest moves to the user
- benchmark solver
- explain why solver won't work on other solitaires
