## Analysis

### The problem

people get bored lol

<!-- TODO: add actual stuff here -->

### Features of the problem that are amenable to computational methods

idk man
<!-- TODO: add actual stuff here too -->

### Why the problem lends itself to a computational solution

it's a video game, it therefore runs on a computer
<!-- TODO: add actual stuff. what isn't todo tbh -->
