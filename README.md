### The problem

people get bored lol

<!-- TODO: add actual stuff here -->

### Features of the problem that are amenable to computational methods

idk man
<!-- TODO: add actual stuff here too -->

### Why the problem lends itself to a computational solution

it's a video game, it therefore runs on a computer
<!-- TODO: add actual stuff. what isn't todo tbh -->

<!-- TODO: get more stakeholders -->

### How the solution is appropriate to the needs of the stakeholders

it's a game

## To-do

- [ ] Create a clear description of the problem
- [ ] Describe and justify of the features of the problem which are solvable by computational methods
- [ ] Explain why the problem is amenable to a computational solution
- [x] Identify and describe the stakeholders in the solution
- [ ] Explain how the solution is appropriate to the needs of the stakeholders
- [ ] Decide on methods of research for each stakeholder
- [ ] Plan interview questions
- [ ] Plan survey questions
- [ ] Decide how I will follow up my research
- [ ] Identify other existing systems or ideas I can research
- [ ] Discuss any suitable approaches to a solution
- [ ] Create a requirements specification
- [ ] Justify each requirement based on the research evidence
- [ ] State measurable success criteria for each requirement
- [ ] Discuss any hardware and software that will be needed
